The following steps are followed for ICP-8:

In Jupiter notepad written the code for the following and mentioned the comments for the code and uploaded the "ICP-8.ipynb" to repo:
 - First installed the packages Keras and Tensorflow.
 - Use Case Description: LeNet5, AlexNet, Vgg16, Vgg19 1. Training the model 2. Evaluating the model 
 - Programming elements: 1. About CNN 2. Hyperparameters of CNN 3. Image classification with CNN
 - In the programming:
 - Tune hyperparameter and make necessary addition to the baseline model to improve validation accuracy and reduce validation loss.  
 - Provided logical description of which steps lead to improved response and what was its impact on architecture behavior.
 - Created at least two more visualizations using matplotlib (Other than provided in the source file) 
 - Used dataset of iris and implemented baseline models provided
 - Apply modified architecture to your own selected dataset and train it. 
 - Evaluate your model on testing set.
 - Save the improved model and use it for prediction on testing data. 
 - Provided plot of confusion matric
 - Provided Training and testing Loss and accuracy plots in one plot using subplot command and history object.
 - Provided at least two more visualizations reflecting your solution.
 - Provided logical description of which steps lead to improved response for new dataset when compared with baseline model and enhance architecture and what was its impact on architecture behavior. 
 
In the "Neural Networks & DL Assignment_7 Screenshots & Github link.pdf" file consists of screenshots of the resultant compiled code and Github link to the repository.

In the Video Link consists of Video regarding the technical explanation of the code.
